# LinkStateRouting
An Applet to Input a Matrix of nodes and Source and Destination node to find Shortest path Between Nodes.

The applet has a simple design that could take upto a 20x20 matrix as input and based on the initial and the final node, The shortest path between the two and the routing table was generated within the applet.

1) Java Applet to accept the input Matrix from a file.

2)Read the file and based on the size of the matrix and the source and destination nodes, Shortest path is found and displayed in the applet along with the routing table.

3)The code is designed to be generic and accepts any size of Matrix, In this case upto a maximum of 20x20.
